ETRep Version 1.2.2

* Updates
- The package description has been updated to include the published version of  
  the paper *"The Mean Shape under the Relative Curvature Condition"*  
  in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics  
  (DOI: <doi:10.1080/10618600.2025.2535600>).

- The plotting issue raised by macOS users due to the lack of native OpenGL  
  support has been fixed by introducing the helper functions  
  `etrep_open3d()` and `etrep_show3d()`.  
  These functions allow plotting to fall back to a WebGL viewer  
  and open the scene in a browser when a native rgl device is not available.
