The Elliptical Tube Interactive App (ETIA) is built on the 
      Elliptical Tube Representation (ETRep) R package, which is designed 
      for modeling and analyzing 3D tube-like structures using skeletal 
      representations. It provides tools for generating elliptical tubes, 
      computing their mean shapes, and incorporating geometric constraints 
      such as the Relative Curvature Condition (RCC)."
