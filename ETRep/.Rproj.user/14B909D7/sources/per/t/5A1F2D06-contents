Description: Provides functions for analyzing elliptical tubes with applications in biological modeling. The package is based on the article "The Mean Shape Under The Relative Curvature Condition" <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.01043>, and PhD Thesis: "Shape Statistics via Skeletal Structures". Key features include constructing discrete elliptical tubes, calculating transformations, validating structures under the Relative Curvature Condition, computing means, and generating simulations. Supports intrinsic and non-intrinsic mean calculations and transformations, size estimation, plotting, and random sample generation based on a reference tube.
