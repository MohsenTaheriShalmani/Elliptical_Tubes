Description: Provides functions for analyzing elliptical tubes (ETReps) with applications in biological modeling. The package is based on the article Taheri, Mohsen and Pizer, Stephen M and Schulz, Joarn "The Mean Shape Under The Relative Curvature Condition" <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.01043>, and Mohsen Taheri Shalmani (2024), PhD Thesis, UiS. "Shape Statistics via Skeletal Structures". Key features include constructing discrete elliptical tubes, calculating transformations, validating structures under the Relative Curvature Condition (RCC), computing means, and generating simulations. Supports intrinsic and non-intrinsic mean calculations and transformations, ETRep size estimation, plotting, and random sample generation based on a reference ETRep.
