If the user has not already set `options(rgl.useNULL)`, this function sets it
to `TRUE` to suppress the typical warning:
\emph{"rgl.init failed, will use the null device"}.}
}
\description{
This special function is called automatically when the ETRep package is loaded.
It ensures that `rgl` uses the off-screen WebGL device (`useNULL = TRUE`)
on macOS and other headless environments, so that package installation
and examples do not fail with an OpenGL error.
