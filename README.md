## Article
### "The Mean Shape under the Relative Curvature Condition"
### Taheri, Mohsen, Stephen M. Pizer, and JÃ¶rn Schulz. Submitted to the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.

## The manuscript provides shape statistics for elliptical tubes, utilizing a relative curvature condition to ensure avoidance of self-intersections.

## Data and R scripts
The "e_Tubes_simulated.RDATA" file contains data of 15 simulated ETReps.\
The "main.R" script loads the simulated data and computes the intrinsic mean shape of the ETReps using the function "mean_tube_basedOnIntrinsicSweptCoordinate()" available in "functionsMeanSweptSkeletal_2.R" script.\
For visualization of both the simulated data and the mean shape, the function "plot_Elliptical_Tube()" is provided in "functionsMeanSweptSkeletal_1.R" script.\
All necessary functions and codes, including intrinsic and semi-intrinsic transformations discussed in the manuscript, are contained in the "subFunctions" folder.
